# Week-9

Honeypot Deployed.

Some of the issues I ran into were small and were related to the setup. One of my main issues was making typo errors and then not cathing it. Downloading the json file from the command was one of my biggest problems. I could not get it to work so I had to download the file manually from the google dashboard.

It was a collection of IP addresses and port numbers that were attacked. Using nmap to scan I ended up with alot of total hacks. Also, using kali linux, another machine, I got more scans.
